overview: |
  This project is a machine learning computer vision system that detects civilians in aerial or
  ground-level video streams. It is designed to identify civilians in both day and night settings,
  and at low and high proximities.

dataset:
  name: "Look Down Folks"
  source: "https://universe.roboflow.com/folks/look-down-folks"
  description: "Annotated imagery focusing on civilian/person detections suitable for aerial perspectives."

results_section: |
  Add evaluation metrics here (if available):
  - Precision: XX.XX
  - Recall: XX.XX
  - mAP@0.5: XX.XX
  - mAP@0.5:0.95: XX.XX

limitations: |
  - May detect false positives when objects appear human-shaped.
  - Performance decreases in very low-light conditions unless enhanced with night vision.
  - Detection accuracy can vary with altitude, camera angle, and motion blur.

future_work: |
  - Improve robustness in low-light/infrared conditions.
  - Reduce false detections from non-human objects.
  - Optimize inference for real-time deployment on drones/edge devices.
