# Aerial Civilian Detection

Civilian detection with drone vision and deep learning (YOLO, Roboflow, PyTorch).

This project is a machine learningâ€“based **computer vision system** that detects civilians from aerial imagery captured by drones. It is designed to work in **day and night conditions**, and can handle both **low and high proximity detections**.  

While the system performs well in varied environments, there are limitations such as:
- Potential **false positives** (e.g., detecting objects shaped like humans).
- **Reduced accuracy in very low light**, unless paired with night-vision technology.
- Environmental conditions (fog, rain, heavy shadows) can impact detection reliability.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Civilian detection from aerial drone vision.
- Supports both daytime and nighttime scenarios.
- Trained with **Roboflowâ€™s Look Down Folks dataset**:  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Roboflow Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/folks/look-down-folks)
- Powered by **YOLO + PyTorch** for real-time detection.
- Exported in **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** format for easy execution.
